‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It is not intended for unauthorized access or malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen utilizes cryptographic standards such as [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for generating potential Bitcoin addresses. The tool is also capable of working with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains using [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing.

The software then compares the generated addresses against known address databases or, in other cases, checks balances in real-time through public blockchain explorers. This method is designed to help you identify the correct Bitcoin address associated with your funds.

Wallet Gen is written in C++ and is open-source. Its open nature allows access and modification of the code. Compared to tools built in Python, Wallet Gen offers substantially higher wallet generation speeds. It uses the power of your CPU and GPU.

##  Why WalletGen?

For a fast and efficient solution for **Bitcoin address recovery**, rely on **WalletGen**.  Engineered in C++ and optimized for multi-threaded CPU and GPU usage, WalletGen's performance is significantly greater (up to **10x faster**) than alternative brute-force tools. If you're exploring lost wallets, verifying seed phrases, or trying to recover your own Bitcoin, WalletGen provides the power and speed necessary.

## Features

-   **Generate Cryptocurrency Wallets:** Quickly generate wallets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, and other cryptocurrencies.
-   **Brute Force Search with Balance:** Use brute-force methods to locate wallets with balances, including both Bitcoin and EVM networks.
-   **Extensive Algorithm Support:** Supports Keccak256 for EVM wallets and BIP39, BIP44, Bech32 algorithms for Bitcoin.
-   **Database for Speed:** Download and utilize databases to speed up the address-finding process.
-   **High-Speed Operation:** Designed to take advantage of your CPU and GPU for maximum performance.
-   **Bitcoin Wallet Recovery (Seed Phrase):** WalletGen gives you the option to recover your bitcoin wallet by seed phrase (mnemonic phrase).

## Supported Blockchains

-   Bitcoin (BTC)
-   Ethereum (ETH)
-   Binance Smart Chain (BNB)
-   Any EVM-compatible chain

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** provides brute-force search methods for finding crypto wallets with balances.

### For Bitcoin (BTC) wallets:

*   Choose option 3 in the menu or run start_search_btc.bat to search Bitcoin wallets via the internet. Note that this method may take longer, since it relies on real-time balance checks.
*   Choose option 6 to search Bitcoin wallets using the database. This approach enables faster results because it compares generated wallets against a pre-built database of known addresses with balances.

### For EVM wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Choose option 5 or run start_search_evm.bat to search EVM wallets over the internet. This verifies balances in real-time.
*   Choose option 6 to search for EVM wallets using the database. This is a more efficient approach, as it compares generated wallets against a database of known balances.

### Speed Considerations:

*   The speed of the search is heavily dependent on your hardware, particularly the GPU. Running multiple program instances (1 to 4) can maximize speed.

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

When the program finds a wallet with a balance:
*   The search will immediately halt.
*   The wallet details will be displayed in the console.
*   This information is saved in the ``found_wallets.txt`` file.

### How to Access the Funds?
1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** from the located wallet into any compatible crypto wallet.
2.  You‚Äôll be able to transfer the funds to your own secure wallet.

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen enables you to recover your Bitcoin wallet via the seed phrase (mnemonic phrase). The program supports entering a complete seed phrase, or searching for missing words.

### Process Description

#### Search for missing words:

If the seed phrase is missing words, use * as a placeholder.

#### Entering a complete seed-phrase:

Enter the full 12-word seed to generate all address types (Legacy, SegWit, P2SH).

### Important recommendations

*   Seed-phrase must contain exactly 12 words.
*   Use only the * symbol to search for missing words.
*   Searching for missing words may take considerable time.
*   Successful recovery stops the program and saves the data.

## My Finds

![mywallet](/img/zoom.webp)

I‚Äôve recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first had 0.000032 BTC, the second contained 0.0528 BTC (roughly $4800 at the time of discovery).
Here‚Äôs the link to the wallet: [bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay](https://mempool.space/address/bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay).
